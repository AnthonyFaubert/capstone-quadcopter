	  <h3>About us!</h3>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>
	  	<br> As the Autonomous Aerial Vision team, we are completing an 
		Embedded Systems Capstone project that leverages the skills 
		we have already developed while learning new ones. For our 
		project, we chose to build a quadcopter that tracks user 
		facial movement and can follow user movement. <br> <br>
		To accomplish 
		this task, we are incorporating computer vision and facial 
		tracking into our design. The quadcopter will also be capable 
		of uploading various kinds of data, such as GPS data and video 
		streaming, to this web server for users to easily view. The 
		Raspberry Pi will handle those computer vision and web-serving 
		tasks, while the STM32F4 microcontroller handles the flight-critical 
		functions of the quadcopter. The Raspberry Pi will need to effectively 
		communicate results from its computer vision tasks in facial tracking to 
    the STM32F4 so that the quadcopter can react to real-time data.  <br> <br>
    
    Our project is also open-source and can be found here: <a href="http://www.google.com">github</a>.<br>

                haptic feedback. Up and down on this joystick control the total throttle sent to the quadcopter, and left and right on 
                the joystick control the directional yaw.

                algorithm that is being processed on the RPi. The yaw of the quadcopter will then rotate to follow a targeted face for as long 
                as the trigger is being held.
