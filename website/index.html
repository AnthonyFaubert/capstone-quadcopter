	  <h3>About us!</h3>
	  <p></p><br />
	  <p>
	    As the Autonomous Aerial Vision team, we are completing our 
	    Embedded Systems Capstone project for EE/CSE 475 at the University 
	    of Washington. This project leverages the skills 
	    we have already developed while learning new ones. For our 
	    project, we chose to build a quadcopter that tracks user 
	    facial movement and can follow user movement.
	    <br /><br />
	    To accomplish 
	    this task, we are incorporating computer vision and facial 
	    tracking into our design. The quadcopter will also be capable 
	    of uploading various kinds of data, such as GPS data and video 
	    streaming, to this web server for users to easily view. The 
	    Raspberry Pi will handle those computer vision and web-serving 
	    tasks, while the STM32F4 microcontroller handles the flight-critical 
	    functions of the quadcopter. The Raspberry Pi will need to effectively 
	    communicate results from its computer vision tasks in facial tracking to 
	    the STM32F4 so that the quadcopter can react to real-time data.
	    <br /><br />
	    
	    Our project is also open-source and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyFaubert/capstone-quadcopter" target="_blank">github</a>.

	    Users can interact with our quadcopter through the use of a Steam Controller.
	    You can find the parts of the Steam Controller that we use and their functional descriptions below.

	  <p>Button Function Descriptions:</p>
	  <br />
	  <table style="text-align:left">
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		1. Throttle and yaw analog "joystick": This joystick is actually a trackpad that functions as a joystick and provides haptic feedback.
		Up and down on this joystick control the total throttle sent to the quadcopter, and left and right on the joystick control the directional yaw.
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		2. Roll and pitch joystick: This joystick is to direct the direction of the quadcopter.
		Its operations is similar to how an user directs its characters in video games; however, in this case, the character is the quadcopter. 
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		3. Trim buttons: The four buttons are used as a "trim" function for the IMU.
		The trim adjusts what the IMU considers a "flat" orientation. 
		Each button is used to adjust each leg of the quadcopter (Y: front leg, B: right leg, A: back leg, and X: left leg). 
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		4. Reset DAQ button: The left center button can be used to reset the data acquisition process on the quadcopter.
	    </td></tr> 
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		5. Start button: The right center button can be used to start the quadcopter's flight.
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		6. Emergency stop button: This bumper is used to Emergency Stop the quadcopter.
		This safety feature shuts off the motors until the quadcopter is reset.
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		7. Camera button: This bumper is used to take a camera frame and turn it into an image that will be uploaded to this website's flight pics section!
	    </td></tr>
	    <tr><td style="padding-bottom:10px">
		8. Auto-mode trigger: This trigger is used to initiate automatic control of the quadcopter.
		Automatic control consists of using the facial tracking algorithm that is being processed on the RPi. The yaw of the quadcopter will then rotate to follow a targeted face for as long as the trigger is being held.
