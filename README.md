## Note on creating code for this project
\t It will be to everyone's advantage if we alocate work to this project in different branches based on the work at hand. **DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ON THE MASTER BRANCH UNLESS YOU HAVE CONSULTED WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER GROUP MEMBERS.** Let's save us all some time and sanity, and just use different branches.  Here's a cool trick to making a new branch in your command line/git bash:

```
// This creates a new branch if the name of this branch does not already exist
git branch "new_branch_name_here" 

// This pushes your new branch to the repository (thus, you can actually push any changes you make to this branch to the respository).
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name_here 

```
